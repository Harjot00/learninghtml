     Samosa is a popular snack originally from Central Asia. It further travelled, with the help of Muslim merchants of trade routes to India.[1] It is famous in the Indian subcontinent as well as Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Southwest Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, the Mediterranean, the Horn of Africa, North Africa, as well as South Africa.

It is generally prepared in the shape of a triangle, however, the shape and sizes tend to vary from region to region.[2] It can be either baked or fried and has an outer hard crust made of plain flour. It usually has a filling of potatoes and spices.[3] It is usually eaten with a spicy sauce called chutney.

Samosa is also an appetiser in <i>Pakistan.</i>

It is commonly available in canteens, sweet shops and is also prepared at home.
